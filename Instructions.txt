Design and implement a Basic REST api for a ﬁeld data collection app. For this exercise, the api will include just users and devices. 
User should have the following attributes:
username:String,
fullName:String,
phoneNumber:String,
devices:Device

And Device should have the following attributes:
deviceType:Enumerated String('iPhone'|'Android'),
deviceModel:String,
name:String
Minimally, the api should allow the creation and retrieval of users and devices. Try to spend no more than 3 hours designing and implementing the api. Pay particular attention to your api design. There isn't a speciﬁc way we want you to put this together, but we do want to understand why you made the decisions you did, Be sure to set aside ten minutes or so to document your choices, as well as explain any additional features you would implement given the time. 
Use any language or tools you would like.
If you ﬁnish quickly and would like to enhance your submission, here are some additional features you could consider:
	REST Updates
	Authentication
	Documentation(openApi/Swagger or similar)
	Additional types/attributes
